# SHA256 HASH TO CVS ROWS âš™

## Description
Takes the CSV provided by the teams, and generates a CHIP-0007 compatible json, calculates the sha256 of the json file and append it to each line in the csv (as `HNGi9 CSV FILE - Sheet1.output.cvs`)

## Usage
- Paste the CSV file in the root directory.
- Replace `HNGi9 CSV FILE - Sheet1.cvs` on *line 4* of `output-hash-cvs.js` with the name of the CSV file (don't forget the .csv extension).
